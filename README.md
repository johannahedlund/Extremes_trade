# Imported exposure to future extreme climate events via transboundary effects of global crop trade

This repository utilizes climate indices data sourced from the CLIMDEX project (https://www.climdex.org), which provides standardized climate extreme indices as defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI).

## Climate Indices included:

Tx90p - Frequency of Hot Days (Percentage of days with maximum temperature above the corresponding calendar day 90th percentile of maximum temperature for a 5-day moving window in the base period)

R95p - Intensity of Precipitation on Very Wet Days (Total annually summed precipitation on days with more daily precipitation than the 95th daily precipitation percentile in the base period)

CDD - Consecutive Dry Days (Maximum number of consecutive days in a year with precipitation below 1 mm)
