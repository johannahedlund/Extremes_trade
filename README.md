# Extreme climate events via transboundary effects of global crop trade

This R code repository utilizes climate indices data sourced from Sandstad M, Schwingshackl C and Iles C 2022 Climate extreme indices and heat stress indicators derived from CMIP6 global climate projections Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Data Store (CDS) 10.24381/cds.776e08bd, which provides standardized climate extreme indices as defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). It also uses import-export data between 2010-2019 from FAO 2023 Detailed trade matrix FAOSTAT (available at: www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data).

The results are published in: Hedlund & Diffenbaugh (2026) Extreme climate events via transboundary effects of global crop trade. Environmental Research: Climate.  https://doi.org/10.1088/2752-5295/ae390b

## Climate indices included:

Tx90p - Frequency of Hot Days (Percentage of days with maximum temperature above the corresponding calendar day 90th percentile of maximum temperature for a 5-day moving window in the base period)

R95p - Intensity of Precipitation on Very Wet Days (Total annually summed precipitation on days with more daily precipitation than the 95th daily precipitation percentile in the base period)

CDD - Consecutive Dry Days (Maximum number of consecutive days in a year with precipitation below 1 mm)

## Commodities included:

Maize, soy, wheat, rice in export quantities, converted to calories using FAO 2021 Technical Conversion Factors for Agricultural Commodities (Statistics Division of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (available at: www.fao.org/economic/the-statistics-division-ess/methodology/methodology-systems/technicalconversion-
factors-for-agricultural-commodities/en/) and re-gridded using Tang F H M, Nguyen T H, Conchedda G, Casse L, Tubiello F N and Maggi F 2024 CROPGRIDS: a global geo-referenced dataset of 173 crops Sci. Data 11 413
